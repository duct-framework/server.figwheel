# Duct server.figwheel

[Integrant][] methods for compiling and dynamically reloading
ClojureScript files in the [Duct][] framework using [Figwheel][].
Figwheel is designed to be used during development. For compiling
ClojureScript for a production release, use [compiler.cljs][].

## Installation

To install, add the following to your project `:dependencies`:

    [duct/server.figwheel "0.3.1"]

## Usage

This library provides the `:duct.server/figwheel` key, and accepts the
same options as Figwheel.

```edn
{:duct.server/figwheel
 {:css-dirs ["dev/resources"]
  :builds   [{:id :dev
              :source-paths  ["src"]
              :build-options {:output-to "target/js/public/main.js"
                              :output-dir "target/js/public"
                              :optimizations :none}}]}}
```

By default the library only takes into account files ending in ".css"
when processing the directories specified in the `:css-dirs` key. If
you want to process other files as CSS files, you can add the
`:css-files-pattern` key and specify a string that will be used as a
regular expression that the relevant files have to match.

Similarly only files ending in ".cljs" or "cljc" will be taken into
account when processing the directories specified in the
`:source-paths` key. Again, you can add a `:source-files-pattern` key
and specify a string that will be used as a regular expression that
the relevant files have to match. In this case, you need to specify
the key for each build you specify in the `:builds` vector.

Here is an example with the default patterns:

```edn
{:duct.server/figwheel
 {:css-dirs ["dev/resources"]
  :css-files-pattern "\\.css$"
  :builds   [{:id :dev
              :source-paths  ["src"]
              :source-files-pattern "\\.clj[sc]$"
              :build-options {:output-to "target/js/public/main.js"
                              :output-dir "target/js/public"
                              :optimizations :none}}]}}
```
